This repository contains my practice work and preparation for my upcoming 2025 internship at Cadence Design Systems.

Leading up to the internship, I focused heavily on sharpening my skills in Bash, Python, algorithm, and some Lisp. I prioritized Python and Bash, as I believe these will be the primary languages and tools I’ll use during my internship. This repository includes the code I wrote and executed as part of my preparation.

It’s important to note that AI tools, particularly ChatGPT, have played a significant role in this process. While I understand the potential risks of over-relying on AI — such as hindering problem-solving skills and motivation — I used ChatGPT to generate tasks, answering conceptual questions, explaining error messages since it allows me to rapidly boost my software familiarity and skills in a limited period of time.
